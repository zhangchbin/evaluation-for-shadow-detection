This is a Pytorch implementation of evaluation for shadow detection.
This code contains metrics: BER, P-Error, N-Error and ACC.

### Enviroment requirements
pytorch >= 1.0

### Run
'''python main.py --result_dir 'your result dir' --gt_dir 'your gt dir' '''
### Note
You should put all the detection results in a dir, and its name should be the same as gt.
